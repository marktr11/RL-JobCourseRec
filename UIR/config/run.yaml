# Data Processing Parameters
level_3: true                                          # Use third level of taxonomy (true) or fourth level (false)
                                                       # True: fewer, more general skills
                                                       # False: more specific skills

# Dataset Size Parameters
nb_courses: 100                                        # Number of courses to include in the dataset
nb_cvs: -1                                            # Number of learner profiles to use (-1 for all)

# Model Parameters
threshold: 0.8                                         # Minimum matching threshold for job eligibility
k: 2                                                 # Number of course recommendations to generate
model: dqn                                          # Reinforcement learning algorithm (DQN, PPO, A2C)
total_steps: 500000                                   # Total training steps
eval_freq: 1000                                       # Evaluation frequency during training
nb_runs: 1                                            # Number of independent runs

# Model Configuration
baseline: True                                        # Model type:
                                                       # true: Baseline model (skip-expertise only)
                                                       # false: Enhanced model with mastery levels and clustering
feature: "Usefulness-as-Rwd"                         # Feature type for non-baseline model 
#options: "Usefulness-as-Rwd" or "Weighted-Usefulness-as-Rwd"

# Purpose
# This configuration is designed to compare different approaches:
# 1. Baseline model: Skip-expertise-only approach (no mastery levels)
# 2. Enhanced model: Mastery levels with clustering and Usefulness as reward
# 3. Advanced model: Weighted combination of job applicability and skill development

# Model Hyperparameters for feature "Weighted-Usefulness-as-Rwd"
